## 01. Weather Observation Station 3(해커랭크)

![image-20220413155730325](/assets/md-images/image-20220413155730325.png)



Query the difference between the maximum and minimum populations in **CITY**.



```sql
-- 내 문제 풀이(정답)
SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE ID % 2 = 0

-- MOD() 활용
SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE MOD(ID, 2) = 0
```





## 02. Weather Observation Station 19(해커랭크)

![image-20220413155730325](/assets/md-images/image-20220413155730325.png)

Consider ***P1(a,c)*** and ***P2(b,d)*** to be two points on a 2D plane where ***(a,b)*** are the respective minimum and maximum values of *Northern Latitude* (*LAT_N*) and ***(c,d)*** are the respective minimum and maximum values of *Western Longitude* (*LONG_W*) in **STATION**.

Query the [Euclidean Distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance) between points ***P1*** and ***P2*** and *format your answer* to display decimal digits.



```sql
-- 내 문제 풀이(정답)
SELECT ROUND(SQRT(POW(MAX(LAT_N)-MIN(LAT_N),2) + POW(MAX(LONG_W)-MIN(LONG_W),2)),4)
FROM STATION
```





## 03. Placements(해커랭크)

![image-20220420145015434](/assets/md-images/image-20220420145015434.png)

You are given three tables: *Students*, *Friends* and *Packages.* *Students* contains two columns: *ID* and *Name*. *Friends* contains two columns: *ID* and *Friend_ID* (*ID* of the ONLY best friend). *Packages* contains two columns: *ID* and *Salary* (offered salary in $ thousands per month).

Write a query to output the names of those students whose best friends got offered a higher salary than them. Names must be ordered by the salary amount offered to the best friends. It is guaranteed that no two students got same salary offer.

```sql
-- 내 문제 풀이(오답) => 문제해석실수 : 친구의 salary 기준으로 order by 해야!
SELECT NAME
FROM Packages P1 INNER JOIN Friends F ON P1.ID = F.ID
                INNER JOIN Students S ON P1.ID = S.ID
                INNER JOIN Packages P2 ON P2.ID = F.Friend_ID
WHERE P1.Salary < P2.Salary
ORDER BY P1.Salary

-- 정답 (Friends 테이블을 기준으로 INNER JOIN 하는 것이 더 깔끔하다.)
SELECT NAME
FROM Friends F INNER JOIN Students S ON F.ID = S.ID
               INNER JOIN Packages P1 ON P1.ID = F.ID
               INNER JOIN Packages P2 ON P2.ID = F.Friend_ID
WHERE P1.Salary < P2.Salary
ORDER BY P2.Salary
```



## 04. Binary Tree Nodes(해커랭크)

![image-20220420151122509](/assets/md-images/image-20220420151122509.png)

You are given a table, *BST*, containing two columns: *N* and *P,* where *N* represents the value of a node in *Binary Tree*, and *P* is the parent of *N*.

Write a query to find the node type of *Binary Tree* ordered by the value of the node. Output one of the following for each node:

- *Root*: If node is root node.
- *Leaf*: If node is leaf node.
- *Inner*: If node is neither root nor leaf node.

```sql
-- 내 문제 풀이(오답)
SELECT N
     , CASE WHEN ISNULL(P) THEN 'Root'
            WHEN N NOT IN (P) THEN 'Leaf'
            ELSE 'Inner'
       END
FROM BST
ORDER BY N

-- LEFT JOIN 활용 (좌측 테이블에 해당 값 없으면 NULL이 되는 성질 활용) => 서브쿼리 활용하면 더 깔끔히 풀이 가능!
SELECT DISTINCT BST.N
     , CASE WHEN BST.P IS NULL THEN 'Root'
            WHEN BST2.N IS NULL THEN 'Leaf'
            ELSE 'Inner'
       END
FROM BST LEFT JOIN BST AS BST2 ON BST.N = BST2.P
ORDER BY BST.N
```
