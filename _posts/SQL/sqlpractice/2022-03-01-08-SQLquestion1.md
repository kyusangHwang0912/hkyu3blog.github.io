![image-20220413151006251](/assets/md-images/image-20220413151006251.png)



A country is **big** if:

- it has an area of at least three million (i.e., `3000000 km2`), or
- it has a population of at least twenty-five million (i.e., `25000000`).

Write an SQL query to report the name, population, and area of the **big countries**.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The query result format is in the following example.



```sql
-- 내 문제 풀이(정답)
SELECT name, population, area
FROM World
WHERE area >= 3000000 OR population >= 25000000;
```

![image-20220413151521610](/assets/md-images/image-20220413151521610.png)

Write an SQL query to report the movies with an odd-numbered ID and a description that is not `"boring"`.

Return the result table ordered by `rating` **in descending order**.

The query result format is in the following example.



```sql
-- 내 문제 풀이(정답)
SELECT id, movie, description, rating
FROM Cinema
WHERE id%2 = 1 AND description != 'boring'
ORDER BY rating DESC

-- MOD 함수 활용
SELECT id, movie, description, rating
FROM Cinema
WHERE MOD(id,2) = 1 AND description != 'boring'
ORDER BY rating DESC
```





## 03. 182 - Duplicate Emails(리트코드)

![image-20220413153238777](/assets/md-images/image-20220413153238777.png)

Write an SQL query to report all the duplicate emails.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The query result format is in the following example.



```sql
-- 내 문제 풀이(정답이긴 하지만 효율적 x => 수정필요)
SELECT P1.email
FROM Person P1 INNER JOIN Person P2 ON P1.id = P2.id
GROUP BY P1.email
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 2

-- 굳이 INNERJOIN 필요없는 문제였다..
SELECT Email
FROM Person
GROUP BY Email
HAVING COUNT(Id) >= 2
```





## 04. 175 - Combine Two Tables(리트코드)

![image-20220413153711178](/assets/md-images/image-20220413153711178.png)

![image-20220413153723124](/assets/md-images/image-20220413153723124.png)



Write an SQL query to report the first name, last name, city, and state of each person in the `Person` table. If the address of a `personId` is not present in the `Address` table, report `null` instead.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The query result format is in the following example.



```sql
SELECT firstName, lastName, city, state
FROM Person P 
	 LEFT JOIN Address A ON P.personId = A.personId
```
